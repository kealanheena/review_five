## Challenge

Create an app that helps keep track of things that have to be done like a todo list. You should be add and remove items. It should also number them. You should enter the commands first followed by the item e.g.


```
"add Dishes"

will return

"1 Dishes"

then if you use

"remove 1"

it'll return

""
```

When adding an item you use it's name and when removing the item you use it's index.

## User Stories

```
As a User,
So I can track my tasks,
I would like to be able to add an item to my todo list.

As a User,
So I can know when I've completed a task,
I would like to be able to remove an item from my todo list.
